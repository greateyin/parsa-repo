# Social Sharing and OpenGraph Implementation

This article demonstrates the enhanced social sharing and OpenGraph features implemented in the redesigned Parsa Hugo theme.

## OpenGraph Meta Tags

OpenGraph meta tags help social media platforms understand and display your content properly when shared. Our implementation includes:

- **Basic OpenGraph tags**: title, description, type, URL, site name
- **Article-specific tags**: published time, modified time, author, section, tags
- **Image optimization**: proper image URLs with alt text support
- **Locale support**: for internationalization

## Social Sharing Features

The theme now includes modern social sharing buttons with:

### Supported Platforms

1. **Twitter** - With proper hashtags and mentions
2. **Facebook** - Direct sharing with OpenGraph data
3. **LinkedIn** - Professional sharing with title and summary
4. **Copy Link** - Modern clipboard API with fallback

### Enhanced User Experience

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Accessibility features with proper ARIA labels
- Visual feedback for successful actions
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Custom Front Matter Support

You can customize social sharing for each article:

```yaml
# Custom OpenGraph settings
