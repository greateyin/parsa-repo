# Mermaid Diagrams Showcase

This post demonstrates the various types of diagrams you can create using Mermaid.js syntax in your Hugo content. The theme automatically detects Mermaid code blocks and renders them as interactive diagrams.

## Flowcharts

Flowcharts are perfect for showing processes, decision trees, and workflows.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is user logged in?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Show Dashboard]
    B -->|No| D[Show Login Form]
    D --> E[User enters credentials]
    E --> F{Valid credentials?}
    F -->|Yes| C
    F -->|No| G[Show error message]
    G --> D
    C --> H[End]
```

### Complex Flowchart Example

Here's a more complex flowchart showing a content publishing workflow:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Content Creation"
        A[Write Article] --> B[Add Images]
        B --> C[Review Content]
    end
    
    subgraph "Review Process"
        C --> D{Content Review}
        D -->|Approved| E[Schedule Publication]
        D -->|Needs Changes| F[Request Revisions]
        F --> A
    end
    
    subgraph "Publication"
        E --> G[Publish Article]
        G --> H[Share on Social Media]
        H --> I[Monitor Analytics]
    end
    
    I --> J[End]
```

## Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams show interactions between different entities over time.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant S as Server
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>B: Enter website URL
    B->>S: HTTP Request
    S->>D: Query user data
    D-->>S: Return data
    S-->>B: HTML Response
    B-->>U: Display webpage
    
    Note over U,D: User authentication flow
    
    U->>B: Click login
    B->>S: POST /login
    S->>D: Validate credentials
    D-->>S: User authenticated
    S-->>B: Set session cookie
    B-->>U: Redirect to dashboard
```

## Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are useful for showing object-oriented relationships.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +String name
        +String email
        +Date createdAt
        +login()
        +logout()
        +updateProfile()
    }
    
    class Article {
        +String title
        +String content
        +Date publishedAt
        +Boolean featured
        +publish()
        +unpublish()
        +addTag()
    }
    
    class Category {
        +String name
        +String slug
        +String description
        +getArticles()
    }
    
    class Tag {
        +String name
        +String color
        +getArticles()
    }
    
    User ||--o{ Article : writes
    Article }o--|| Category : belongs to
    Article }o--o{ Tag : has many
```

## State Diagrams

State diagrams show the different states of a system and transitions between them.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Review : Submit for review
    Review --> Published : Approve
    Review --> Draft : Request changes
    Published --> Archived : Archive
    Archived --> Published : Restore
    Published --> [*] : Delete
    Draft --> [*] : Delete
```

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

ER diagrams show database relationships and structure.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email UK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    
    ARTICLE {
        int id PK
        string title
        text content
        int user_id FK
        int category_id FK
        boolean featured
        datetime published_at
        datetime created_at
    }
    
    CATEGORY {
        int id PK
        string name UK
        string slug UK
        text description
    }
    
    TAG {
        int id PK
        string name UK
        string color
    }
    
    ARTICLE_TAG {
        int article_id FK
        int tag_id FK
    }
    
    USER ||--o{ ARTICLE : writes
    CATEGORY ||--o{ ARTICLE : contains
    ARTICLE }o--o{ TAG : tagged_with
```

## User Journey Diagrams

User journey diagrams map out user experiences and touchpoints.

```mermaid
journey
    title User Blog Reading Experience
    section Discovery
      Search for topic: 5: User
      Find blog post: 4: User
      Click on link: 5: User
    section Reading
      Load page: 3: User, System
      Read introduction: 5: User
      View diagrams: 5: User
      Read full content: 4: User
    section Engagement
      Share on social: 4: User
      Leave comment: 3: User
      Subscribe to newsletter: 5: User
    section Return
      Bookmark page: 4: User
      Return later: 5: User
      Read related posts: 5: User
```

## Gantt Charts

Gantt charts are perfect for project timelines and scheduling.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Blog Development Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Planning
    Research topics           :done,    research, 2025-10-01, 2025-10-05
    Create content calendar   :done,    calendar, 2025-10-06, 2025-10-08
    section Content Creation
    Write blog posts         :active,  writing,  2025-10-09, 2025-10-20
    Create diagrams          :         diagrams, 2025-10-15, 2025-10-18
    Review content           :         review,   2025-10-21, 2025-10-23
    section Publication
    Schedule posts           :         schedule, 2025-10-24, 2025-10-25
    Publish content          :         publish,  2025-10-26, 2025-10-30
    Promote on social media  :         promote,  2025-10-26, 2025-11-02
```

## Pie Charts

Pie charts are great for showing proportional data.

```mermaid
pie title Website Traffic Sources
    "Organic Search" : 45
    "Direct Traffic" : 25
    "Social Media" : 15
    "Email Marketing" : 10
    "Paid Advertising" : 5
```

## Git Graphs

Git graphs show version control workflows and branching strategies.

```mermaid
gitgraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "Add basic structure"
    branch feature/analytics
    checkout feature/analytics
    commit id: "Add Google Analytics"
    commit id: "Add Facebook Pixel"
    checkout main
    merge feature/analytics
    commit id: "Update documentation"
    branch feature/adsense
    checkout feature/adsense
    commit id: "Add AdSense integration"
    commit id: "Add ad placements"
    checkout main
    merge feature/adsense
    commit id: "Release v2.0"
```

## Using Mermaid Shortcodes

You can also use the Mermaid shortcode for more control:

{{< mermaid >}}
mindmap
  root((Blog Theme))
    Analytics
      Google Analytics
      Facebook Pixel
      Custom Events
    Advertising
      Google AdSense
      Ad Placements
      Revenue Optimization
    Content
      Mermaid Diagrams
      Rich Shortcodes
      SEO Optimization
    Performance
      Lazy Loading
      Async Scripts
      Core Web Vitals
{{< /mermaid >}}

## Customizing Diagram Appearance

You can customize the appearance of your diagrams by configuring the Mermaid theme in your Hugo configuration:

```toml
[params.mermaid]
  enabled = true
  theme = "default"  # Options: default, dark, forest, neutral, base
  
[params.mermaid.flowchart]
  useMaxWidth = true
  htmlLabels = true
```

## Best Practices for Diagram Creation

1. **Keep it Simple**: Don't overcomplicate diagrams with too many elements
2. **Use Consistent Styling**: Stick to a consistent color scheme and layout
3. **Add Descriptive Labels**: Make sure all elements are clearly labeled
4. **Consider Mobile Users**: Ensure diagrams are readable on small screens
5. **Test Rendering**: Always preview your diagrams before publishing

## Accessibility Considerations

- Provide alternative text descriptions for complex diagrams
- Use sufficient color contrast in custom themes
- Consider providing tabular data as an alternative to visual diagrams
- Test with screen readers when possible

## Conclusion

Mermaid diagrams are a powerful way to enhance your content with visual elements. They're particularly useful for technical documentation, process explanations, and data visualization. The theme's automatic detection and rendering makes it easy to include diagrams in your Hugo content without any additional setup.

Try creating your own diagrams using the examples above as a starting point. The Mermaid syntax is intuitive and well-documented, making it easy to create professional-looking diagrams for your blog posts and documentation.
